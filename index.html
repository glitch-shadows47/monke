    <h1>Number 15, Burger King Foot Lettuce:</h1>
    <p>The last thing you'd want in your Burger King Burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get.<br> A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce with the statement 'This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King.'<br> Admittedly, he had shoes on. But that's even worse.<br> The post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo,<br> which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights,<br> Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three Minutes later at 11:50, Burger King<br> branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment.<br> Five minutes later, the news station was contacted by another<br> 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's 'Tell Us About Us' online form. The foot photo, otherwise known<br> as Exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted<br> the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast<br> shift manager said 'Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired.' Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.</p>
